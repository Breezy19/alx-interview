# Island Perimeter Function

Contained within this directory is the solution and implementation for the following task:

Develop a function `island_perimeter(grid)` that computes the perimeter of the island defined in the grid:

- `grid` is a list of lists of integers:
- 0 signifies water
- 1 signifies land
- Each cell is square, with a side length of 1
- Cells are horizontally/vertically connected (not diagonally).
- The grid is rectangular, with width and height not surpassing 100
- The grid is entirely encircled by water
- There exists only one island (or none).
- The island lacks "lakes" (water inside not linked to the surrounding water).

## Utilized Resources

For the "0. Island Perimeter" project, you'll need to employ your understanding of algorithms, data structures (particularly matrices or 2D lists), and iterative or conditional logic to tackle a geometric issue within a grid context. The objective is to determine the perimeter of a solitary island in a grid, where the grid is represented by a 2D array of integers. Proficiency in navigating and analyzing 2D arrays, and applying logical operations to ascertain perimeter calculation conditions is essential for this task.

### Essential Concepts:

**2D Arrays (Matrices):**

- Accessing and iterating through elements in a 2D array.
Understanding traversal through adjacent cells (horizontally and vertically).

**Conditional Logic:**

- Applying conditions to ascertain whether a cell contributes to the island's perimeter.

**Counting Techniques:**

- Establishing a methodology to count the edges contributing to the island's perimeter.

**Problem-Solving Strategies:**

- Breaking down the problem into smaller tasks, like identifying land cells and computing their contribution to the perimeter.

**Python Programming:**

- Nested loops for traversing grid cells.
- Conditional statements to verify adjacent cell statuses.
